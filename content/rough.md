okay, i'm getting tired of this discussion, so i'm just going to respond to everything at once.

   "the time it takes to go from nothing to a working environment, and the ongoing maintenance, is much more for linux."
   
here’s what’s actually true:
- linux comes with git, python, and gcc already installed.
- you can install everything you need with a single command.
- you don’t have to sign in or create a microsoft account to use your computer.
- setup only takes more time if you choose a build-it-yourself system, and that’s a tradeoff that pays off later.
- linux lets you build reproducible systems. windows does not.
- even arch linux, which people say is unstable, only requires you to update regularly, check the arch news, and make backups. avoid sketchy/orphaned aur packages and you’re fine.
- dependency problems are more common on old distros. they can be avoided if you stick to one package manager and don’t mix tools. things like flatpak, appimage, nix, and guix also help a lot. this is not a major issue on personal systems anymore.
- windows gets in your way. linux does not.
- yes, you may spend more time at the beginning setting things up, but that time pays off. once your system fits your needs, you get more done, faster.
- automation is harder on windows. scripting and tool integration are just not as smooth.
- troubleshooting on windows is frustrating. logs are hard to find and error messages are often useless. on linux, logs are easy to access and help you figure out what's wrong.
- linux is open source. you can inspect, modify, and control your system completely. windows is closed and locked down in many areas.
- linux doesn't track you. windows collects telemetry by default and makes it hard to fully disable.
- linux runs faster on older or low-spec hardware. it doesn't need gigabytes of ram just to boot and sit idle.
- you have full control over updates on linux. windows can reboot your system without warning and install updates you didn't ask for.
- linux offers real package managers. windows is still catching up with tools like winget and chocolatey, and they don’t cover everything.
- linux has better support for development tools and workflows. it's the environment most devs use to build the internet.
- containerization (like docker) works better on linux. it’s native, faster, and less buggy than on windows.
- linux has a massive selection of lightweight, minimal desktop environments. you can run a full GUI on less than 500mb ram.
- linux is more stable long term. you can leave a server or workstation running for months or years without needing a reboot.
- linux lets you fully customize your UI, keybindings, services, startup behavior, everything.
- when something breaks on linux, you can fix it. when something breaks on windows, you usually just reinstall or hope for a patch.
- linux respects the user’s control. windows assumes you're the product.
