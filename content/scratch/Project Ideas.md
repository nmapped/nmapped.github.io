+ Ozone layer prediction analysis. Using data about carbon emissions in certain locations, industrial activity, etc predict the ozone layer levels around such a region. Then try to predict the future levels using the trends in the data. Just analyze the data and see how you can make it useful in predicting/analyzing the state of the Ozone layer. Then try and visualize the data in a pretty way e.g. a heat map, etc.
